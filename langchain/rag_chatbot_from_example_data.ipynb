In 1990, East Asia and Pacific had a higher poverty rate than \\nSub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia had rates similar to Sub-Saharan Africa. This picture \\nchanged markedly over the years. Fueled by rapid growth, East Asia and Pacific experienced \\nunprecedented progress that also drove poverty reduction at the global level. Until 2013, global \\nextreme poverty reduction was led by China’s rapid economic growth, which lifted more than \\n800 million people out of extreme poverty over three decades. Between 1990 and 2024, the rest \\nof East Asia and Pacific also made remarkable progress, with 210 million people exiting extreme \\npoverty during this period. Extreme poverty also fell significantly in South Asia, despite recent \\nstagnation (see chapter 1).\\nSince the early 2010s, progress in reducing global extreme poverty has depended on the \\nreduction of poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa much more than it did before. Although the \\nextreme poverty rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen over the past three decades, it did so at \\nmuch slower rates than in other regions, and the number of people living in extreme poverty \\nin the region has come fairly close to doubling—rising from 282 million in 1990 to 464 million \\nin 2024. Similarly, in the Middle East and North Africa, the number of people living in extreme \\npoverty doubled from 15 million in 1990 to 30 million in 2024.

      "\n",
